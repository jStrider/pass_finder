### pf

pf stand for pass find

it's a tool I use to search into my [passwordstore](https://www.passwordstore.org/#download)

for now it works only on MacOS.

usage : 

`pf <keyword1> <keyword2> ...`

you can enter as many keyword you want, it miust be in order

then pf decrypt the pass with the pass utility and copy it to your clipboard and write down the path. it was usefull for me because im using ansible lookup to get the password and sometimes I do not remember the path
